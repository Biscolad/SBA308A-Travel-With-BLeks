# SBA308A-Travel-With-BLeks
This project is a simple travel website that allows users to search for destination countries and view information and images related to those countries. It integrates with an external API to retrieve data and provide a basic user interface to interact with the data.
To interact with this web page, a user must enter the name of a destination country in the "Enter Destination Country" input field, click the "Search" button to retrieve information about the entered country. The retrieved information will be displayed on the screen.
The project used the "Travel info API" to fetch country-related data and communicates with the API using the Fetch API and displays the data on the website.
